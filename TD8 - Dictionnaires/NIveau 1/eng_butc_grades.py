"""
Lore:
The literary critics' ratings are available! What rating did each book receive?

Instructions:
Write a function that takes as input the dictionary ratings and the string book_title. 
This function returns the rating of the book based on the key book_title. 
If the book is not in the dictionary, it returns -1.

Forbidden : use of get()

Hint 1: Use the 'in' operator to check if a key exists in the dictionary.
Hint 2: If the key exists, use dictionary[key] to get the associated value.
Hint 3: If the key does not exist, return -1.
Hint 4: Use an if-else conditional structure to handle both cases.
